# About AutoYoutube-DL
AutoYoutube-DL is a open-source GUI application for youtube-dl, since youtube-dl is a command-line program which means it doesnâ€™t have a user interface, it can be very confuse to config it properly,  so I created this application intend to make it easy to use and user friendly, its currently in beta which means it may have bugs or crash.
